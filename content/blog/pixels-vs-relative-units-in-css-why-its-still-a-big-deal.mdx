For the past few years, I've been working on integrating accessibility as a core feature of software applications. Creating a style architecture that utilizes relative CSS units and unitless values is a key part of crafting an experience that includes users that rely on zooming to browse the web.

## Writing the thoughts down

Last December, after wrapping up a series of [conference talks](https://noti.st/resource11) about accessibility, React component libraries, and design systems, I had the privilege of being invited to write about the topic on [24 Accessibility](https://twitter.com/24accessibility). [Pixels vs. Relative Units in CSS: why it’s still a big deal](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/pixels-vs-relative-units-in-css-why-its-still-a-big-deal/) illustrates why supporting zooming for your fonts is important, and provides a [side-by-side browser zoom CodePen example] showing how a block of text appears in the browser when zoomed in to 200% using different settings.
