I’m not sure about any of y’all, but I have more that one personal site that I’ve created over the years, using the technology of the time. Every once in a while, I’d look back at that site and think “wow, you should really update that code, Kathleen.”

## Why Digital Gardening

When I first heard the term digital gardening, it really struck a chord with me because it was the perfect blend of what works for me. I could create a site that’s more of a catch-all for my interests, publish what I want, without thinking of the “state of done”, and keep moving. If I want to make a code reference for future me to remember something I learned at the time? If I want to go back and edit? Cool. If not, no big deal.

## React component support

<DisplayBox>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</DisplayBox>

```jsx
<Button>Click me</Button>
```
