Another short writeup for the[100 Days of Gatsby Challenges](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs/status/1208068118335119364). This one involved [making your Gatsby site into a Progressive Web App](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/pwa/) so your site will work well with poor internet service and if you're offline. This challenge involved using [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest) and [gatsby-plugin-offline](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline).

Much of this was covered in [Tutorial Part 8](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-eight/) of the [first challenge](/write/100-days-of-gatsby-challenge-01), so this challenge is completed.
