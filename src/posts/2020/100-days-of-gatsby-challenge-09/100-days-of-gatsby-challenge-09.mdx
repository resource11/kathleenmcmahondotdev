## [Challenge 9: Help Your Site Rank No. 1 in Search Engines](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/seo/#challenge-9-help-your-site-rank-no-1-in-search-engines)

When following the [Adding an SEO component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/) tutorial, I noticed that the guidance initially indicated to declare a `location` const through the `useLocation()` method, then switched to using `pathname` instead. Why?

I noticed that in the [add page metadata](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-eight/#add-page-metadata) section of [Gatsby Tutorial part 8](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-eight) took a different approach for passing in the metadata into the [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) component. Which way is optimal? I’m assuming the latter option because of the fallback prop structure.

I got a bit stuck creating a sitemap. I followed the instructions, yet it wasn’t clear how to test the solution. Do you generate a static build and deploy to test? Can you test this while running the site locally? I couldn’t see that sitemap.xml page when running locally using `npm run start`

I referred to the [Gatsby tutorial part 8 - Preparing a site to go live](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-eight/) page, tried a `gatsby build` and threw an error in the GraphQL request:

```bash
Cannot query field "siteUrl" on type "SiteSiteMetadata".
GraphQL request:13:7
12 |     siteMetadata {
13 |       siteUrl
   |       ^
14 |     }
```

I looked at the instructions again. The [gatsby-plugin-advanced-sitemap](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-advanced-sitemap/) uses the `siteUrl` key rather than the `url` key, which is used for the SEO tutorial. Once I added that key, in addition to the `url` key, the sitemap would build. Still need to test this in the deployed site to see if the pages populate in the sitemap.

Question: for things like sitemaps and Lighthouse, we must always create a production build (gatsby build) and serve it locally (gatsby serve) to test for SEO and performance things? Ahh, this is answered in [Challenge 10](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/performance) in the [audit with Lighthouse](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/audit-with-lighthouse/):

> The Gatsby development server is optimized for making development fast, but the site that it generates, while closely resembling a production version of the site, isn’t as optimized.
