Intro paragraph

## Build and Deploy Your Gatsby Site (Using Free Tools)

This challenge involved getting set up with a [free site hosting](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/free-hosting) service. I chose to test out two services at once: [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to try out hosting the 100DaysOfGatsby challenges site and used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host my [kathleenmcmahon.dev](https://kathleenmcmahon.dev) site. I'm not sure if I needed to use a CMS for the challenges site, so skipped that step in the process.

At the time, I noticed a suggestion to upgrade to `gatsby@^2.19.9`, followed the steps and discovered my project had [package security vulnerabilities](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities), 6 low and 9 high vulnerabilities. I fixed 6 using `npm audit fix`. The 9 high vulnerabilities have no patch available at the moment.

Oooo… the Gatsby Cloud builds for my challenges site are quite nice… and this is a draw for me:

> “Gatsby Cloud can **automatically deploy** each site build to a CDN host of your choice—just connect and you are good to go!"

The setup to host a site was definitely more straightforward than using the [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co) workflow that we use at O'Reilly Media to deploy our design system documentation site. When using Zeit, we had to build a static site before deploying, and set up our config in a specific way, depending on whether we were using `v1` or `v2` of `Now`. There definitely were some gymnastics involved with the local config files. Also, I haven't been a fan of the way Zeit would request read/write access to Administration to **all** your GitHub repositories in order to use the service, rather than the way Gatsby Cloud and Netlify allow you to grant [scoped repository access](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/repo-permissions-linking/#authentication-with-the-netlify-github-app) permissions. In fact, that blanket permission request by Zeit has long been a big barrier to entry for users who want to contribute to our design system documentation.

Now that Zeit has now been rebranded as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as of late April 2020, and it looks like they may be changing how you can deploy sites with their service, I'm wondering if they'll change that permissions model.

After I set up the challenges site on Gatsby Cloud, I set up hosting with Netlify for my blog site, by sigining up for a starter plan and creating a team. In that team, I created a unique site name, purchased a domain name for my blog site, and pointed my deployment to that URL to act as the primary domain. Pretty seamless process.

Things I learned:

1. You can’t use the [Deploy to Netlify button](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/11/29/introducing-the-deploy-to-netlify-button/) in your README if your GitHubrepository is private.

2. You can point your Gatsby Cloud build to a URL created in your Netlify team. Nice.
