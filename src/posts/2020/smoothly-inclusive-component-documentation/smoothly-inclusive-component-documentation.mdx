} from "../../../../src/components"

## Buttons

Allows users to perform single-click actions such as adding, deleting, or submitting an event.

### Editable fancy code

Behold! Pass `react-live` as a prop to your `jsx` codeblock and edit away.

```jsx react-live
  <Button>Click me</Button>
```
---

### Syntax highlighting

You can have nice syntax highlighting with `prism-react-renderer`
<p></p>

```jsx
  <Button>Click me</Button>
```
---

### Non-editable code

Pair your static code with a component by passing the `displaybox` prop to the `jsx` codeblock.

```jsx displaybox
  <Button>Click me</Button>
```
