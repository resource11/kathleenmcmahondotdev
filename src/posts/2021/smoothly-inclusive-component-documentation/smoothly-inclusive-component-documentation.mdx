import {
  Button,
  Card,
  CTALink,
  DisplayBox,
  Icon,
  Link,
} from "../../../../src/components"

## Button

Buttons allow users to perform single-click actions such as adding, deleting, or submitting an event.

---

### Editable fancy code

Behold! Pass `react-live` as a prop to your `jsx` codeblock and edit away.

```jsx react-live
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

---

### Syntax highlighting

You can have nice syntax highlighting with `prism-react-renderer`

<p></p>

```jsx
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

---

### Non-editable code

Pair your static code with a component by passing the `displaybox` prop to the `jsx` codeblock.

```jsx displaybox
<Button>Click me</Button>
```
