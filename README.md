## Motivation

This is a much-needed update for my personal website. It's less a portfolio and more a centralized reference for all my various internet-related activities.

## Installation

This website is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)

From there, you can follow enchilada's setup instructions. Let me know if you run into any issues!

## Contributing

As it is my personal website, I'm not really looking for feature requests for this project. I would, however, love to get bug reports, especially about accessibility issues, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability criticism.

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/resource11/kathleenmcmahondotdev/issues). Please make sure you read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/resource11/kathleenmcmahondotdev#contributing) before doing so!

If you can't or won't use GitHub, I can also be reached on Twitter, as well as on the other social networking services linked to on my site.
